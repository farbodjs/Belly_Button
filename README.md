## Data Visualization project using JavaScript
The goal of this project is to visualize the bacterial data https://github.com/farbodjs/Belly_Button/blob/main/js/data.js for each volunteer by creating an interactive dashboard to visualize the bacterial data for a group of volunteers for the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons.
